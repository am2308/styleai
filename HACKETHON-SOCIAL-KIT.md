Building StyleAI: Technical Challenges and Solutions üõ†Ô∏è

Creating an AI-powered personal stylist with 3D visualization presented unique challenges:

Challenge 1: Real-time 3D rendering in browser
Solution: Three.js with React Three Fiber for performant WebGL rendering

Challenge 2: Personalized body modeling
Solution: Algorithmic body type adaptation with realistic proportions

Challenge 3: Scalable AI recommendations  
Solution: Hybrid recommendation engine combining collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms

Challenge 4: Global performance
Solution: Serverless AWS architecture with CloudFront CDN

The result? Sub-second response times globally with photorealistic 3D visualization that adapts to each user's unique characteristics.

Technical stack:
‚Ä¢ Frontend: React + TypeScript + Three.js
‚Ä¢ Backend: AWS Lambda + DynamoDB + S3
‚Ä¢ AI: Custom recommendation algorithms + external APIs
‚Ä¢ Infrastructure: Serverless with auto-scaling

Key learnings:
1. Performance optimization is crucial for 3D web applications
